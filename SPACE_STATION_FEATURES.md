## üìä Mission-Critical Logging

### NASA Mission Log Format
```json
{
  "mission_time": "GMT 289:14:32:15",
  "timestamp_utc": "2024-10-15T21:32:15.123Z",
  "station_module": "HARMONY",
  "crew_member": "ISS067",
  "system": "AI_VISION_EMERGENCY_DETECTION",

```

### Criticality Assessment
- **CRITICAL** - Life threatening, immediate action required
- **HIGH** - Safety equipment missing/damaged
- **MEDIUM** - Equipment needs attention
- **NOMINAL** - All systems operational

## üéõÔ∏è Configuration

### Equipment Requirements
Each piece of equipment has defined:
- **Criticality Level** - Response priority
- **Maximum Response Time** - Time to address issue
